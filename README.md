# A Car Purchase Prediction Model
A prediction model implemented using artifical neural networks and linear regression.

# Algorithms Used

## Linear Regression
A linear approach to modeling linear a relationship between a dependent variable(y) and one or more independent variables(x). 

## Artificial Neural Networks
It is a multi-layered structure where every node in one layer is connected to every other node in the next layer. It consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. This model can be made deeper and more efficient by increasing the number of layers.

## Back Propogation
Backpropagation is a method used to train ANNs by calculating gradient needed to update network weights. It is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function. 


# Implementation
## Dataset Provided
The given dataset consists of parameters like :
* Customer Name
* Customer e-mail
* Country
* Gender
* Age
* Annual Salary 
* Credit Card Debt 
* Net Worth 

The model is supposed to provide an estimate amount of money an indivual can spend on buying a car based on these parameters.
